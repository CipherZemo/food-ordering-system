# This is the backend of the project
This project is a comprehensive, full-stack Online Food Ordering System designed to be a robust, real-world application suitable for a professional portfolio or as a foundation for a commercial business. The system features two primary interfaces: a polished, user-friendly customer-facing website and a dynamic, real-time kitchen dashboard. Customers can browse a menu, customize items, add them to a cart, create an account, and securely pay online using Stripe. The kitchen staff will use a separate, protected dashboard where new orders appear instantly via WebSockets. They can manage the entire order lifecycle, updating its status from 'Received' to 'Preparing' and 'Ready for Pickup'. These status updates are then communicated back to the customer through their personal order history page and via email notifications. The project also includes a complete administrative backend for managing menu items (including photos), prices, and categories. As a portfolio piece, this roadmap includes enhancements such as user profiles with order history, a customer review and rating system, and is structured for professional deployment, including testing and containerization.
